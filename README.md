## Overview
During the last week of our full-stack programming bootcamp, we participated in a 24-hour hackathon. The challenge was to create a web app under the general theme 'Childhood Throwback', having been assigned to us the TV show *Saint Seiya*.

With only 24 hours on the clock, we successfully completed a full-stack web application (using JavaScript, HTML and CSS) where players can enjoy an educational and fun Astrology and Astronomy trivia quiz.


## Features
- Randomized questions with 3 levels of difficulty
- Multiple choice questions
- Limited fails per level
- Fully compatible with mobile devices


## Gameplay
The players will embark on a journey through the twelve houses corresponding to the twelve zodiac signs, each level testing their knowledge regarding our universe.

As the game advances, the questions will become harder and harder. There's a hidden feature to he**L**p the p**L**ayer in these moments, can you find the secret key?
